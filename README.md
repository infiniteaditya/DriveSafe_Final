# DriveSafe

## Description
A prototype to measure attentiveness of drivers while driving to reduce road accidents.

## Detailed Plan of the Project

As this project is being developed from the scratch initial approach to the project will be a bit different.
Starting three days will be given for research where I will provide some reference material and basic code to start.
At the end of the research period, a model will be assigned to each student.
### Individual tasks for coding period
#### 1) Implemtation
To train and implement the assigned model. It should be looking for all the necessary features. 
#### 2) Improvement
 Improve the model by changing or adding parameters to increase accuracy.
#### 3) Documention 
Documentation of the work done so far.

## Additional Details/Motive
With this project, I will try my best to give students an initial push or experience towards open source as the work done will be close to how open source organizations work. Also, this project will help students in increasing their knowledge of ML.
I am open to all the ideas. We will discuss and work on it.
